# About
Eclipse will not automatically delete old plugins and old features after its automatic update. This tool is expected to delete these old modules and free the disk space.

**NOTE: This project is still under development yet, *DO NOT* build and use it!**

# Known issue
Some plugins have not been updated but some of their dependencies have been updated to a newer version, if the tool only remains these dependencies of the latest version, plugins depend on them may be failed to get an available version.
